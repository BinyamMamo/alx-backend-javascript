# Project: ES6 Data Manipulation 🚀

This project was a breath of fresh air to my JavaScript world as I explored various ES6 methods of data manipulation. 🌐 I went into arrays, set, and map data structures, understanding their distinctive properties and, consequently, in different situations. As I went deeper, I realize that the array methods like map, filter, and reduce are truly the power house methods because they give me the flexibility to treat data in a more subtle and sophisticated way. Furthermore, I laid my hands on the enigmas of unraveling the weakly linked data structures, by distinguishing their character from the self-assuring type of data structures.🕵️‍♀️

## Tasks

| Task                           | Files Used                        | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Collection**     | [data_collection.py](./data_collection.py)              | Gathered data from various sources and cleaned it.                                           |
| **Feature Engineering** | [feature_engineering.ipynb](./feature_engineering.ipynb)       | Engineered new features based on domain knowledge.                                            |
| **Model Training**      | [model_training.py](./model_training.py)            | Trained a machine learning model using the provided dataset.                                  |
| **Evaluation**          | [evaluation.ipynb](./evaluation.ipynb)        | Evaluated model performance using test data.                                                  |
| **Deployment**          | [app.py](./app.py), [templates/index.html](./templates/index.html)  | Deployed the model as a web application using Flask.                                          |
