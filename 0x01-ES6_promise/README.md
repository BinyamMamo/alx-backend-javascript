In this project, I had the opportunity to explore the powerful concept of Promises in JavaScript ES6. I delved into the intricacies of asynchronous operations and learned how to effectively manage them using `then`, `resolve`, `catch`, and other Promise methods. Additionally, I gained practical experience with the `await` operator and `async` functions, which are essential for writing clean and efficient code.

## Tasks üìù

| Task | Files Used | Description |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep | `0-promise.js` | Implement a function that returns a Promise prototype. |
| 1. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it | `1-promise.js` | Create a promise that resolves or rejects based on a boolean parameter. |
| 2. Catch me if you can! | `2-then.js` | Handle resolved and rejected promises with appropriate handlers. |
| 3. Handle multiple successful promises | `3-all.js` | Use `Promise.all` to handle multiple promises and log results. |
| 4. Simple promise | `4-user-promise.js` | Return a resolved promise with user information. |
| 5. Reject the promises | `5-photo-reject.js` | Write a function that returns a rejected promise with an error message. |
| 6. Handle multiple promises | `6-final-user.js` | Manage multiple promises and return an array with their statuses and values. |
| 7. Load balancer | `7-load_balancer.js` | Create a function that returns the result of the fastest resolved promise. |
| 8. Throw error / try catch | `8-try.js` | Write a function that throws an error when division by zero is attempted. |
| 9. Throw an error | `9-try.js` | Develop a function that handles errors and maintains a processing queue. |

## Conclusion üéâ
Completing the ES6 Promises project has significantly enhanced my understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. I've learned to handle various scenarios with promises, from simple resolutions to complex error handling. This knowledge is invaluable for developing responsive and robust applications. I'm excited to apply these concepts in future projects! ‚ú®
