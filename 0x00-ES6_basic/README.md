This project is about learning the basics of ES6, the new version of JavaScript. I learned how to use new features such as `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals, classes, modules, and more. I also practiced writing unit tests using Jest and following the Airbnb style guide using ESLint and Babel.

## Tasks

| Task | Files used | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Const or let? | 0-constants.js, 0-main.js | Write a file that modifies the value of `myVar` using `let` or `const` |
| 1. Block Scope | 1-block-scoped.js, 1-main.js | Write a file that modifies the value of `myVar` using `var`, `let`, and `const` |
| 2. Arrow functions | 2-arrow.js, 2-main.js | Write a file that replaces `var` with `let` and anonymous functions with arrow functions |
| 3. Parameter defaults | 3-default-parameter.js, 3-main.js | Write a file that assigns default values to function parameters |
| 4. Rest parameter syntax for functions | 4-rest-parameter.js, 4-main.js | Write a file that uses the rest parameter syntax to collect all arguments into an array |
| 5. The wonders of spread syntax | 5-spread-operator.js, 5-main.js | Write a file that uses the spread operator syntax to concatenate two arrays and create a new string |
| 6. Take advantage of template literals | 6-string-interpolation.js, 6-main.js | Write a file that uses template literals to create a function that takes a string and returns a formatted message |
| 7. Object property value shorthand syntax | 7-getBudgetObject.js, 7-main.js | Write a file that uses the property value shorthand syntax to create an object |
| 8. No need to create empty objects before adding properties | 8-getBudgetCurrentYear.js, 8-main.js | Write a file that uses the computed property name syntax to create an object |
| 9. ES6 method properties | 9-getFullBudget.js, 9-main.js | Write a file that uses the method property shorthand syntax to create an object |
| 10. For...of Loops | 10-loops.js, 10-main.js | Write a file that uses a `for...of` loop to iterate over an array |
| 11. Iterator | 11-createEmployeesObject.js, 11-main.js | Write a file that creates an object with four different attributes using an iterator |
| 12. Let's create a report object | 12-createReportObject.js, 12-main.js | Write a file that creates a report object with two methods: `allEmployees` and `getNumberOfDepartments` |
| 13. Iterating through report object | 100-createIteratorObject.js, 100-main.js | Write a file that creates an iterator object that iterates through the report object |
| 14. Generate ES6 static methods using the "static" keyword | 101-iterateThroughObject.js, 101-main.js | Write a file that uses a static method to iterate through the report object and return a formatted string |
| 15. Class Syntax | 102-hello.js, 102-main.js | Write a file that defines and exports a class named `HelloClass` |
| 16. Inheritance | 103-hello_child.js, 103-main.js | Write a file that defines and exports a class named `ChildClass` that inherits from `HelloClass` |
| 17. Getter and setter | 104-es6_classes.js, 104-main.js | Write a file that defines and exports a class named `Currency` with a constructor, a getter, and a setter |
| 18. Class factory | 105-createClass.js, 105-main.js | Write a file that defines and exports a function that creates a class with a constructor and two methods |
| 19. Generator function | 106-generators.js, 106-main.js | Write a file that defines and exports a generator function that yields a sequence of values |
| 20. Generator function* with yield* | 107-generator-function.js, 107-main.js | Write a file that defines and exports a generator function that delegates to another generator function |
| 21. Import | 108-import.js, 108-main.js | Write a file that imports a function from another file and executes it |
| 22. Export | 109-export.js, 109-main.js | Write a file that exports a function that returns the addition of two numbers |

This project was a great way to learn and practice the new features of ES6, which make JavaScript more expressive, concise, and powerful. I enjoyed writing cleaner and more readable code using arrow functions, template literals, classes, modules, and more. I also learned how to use Jest for testing, ESLint for linting, and Babel for transpiling. I think these skills will help me become a better JavaScript developer and write more modern and maintainable code.
